        <div align="center">O Canada! Our home and native land!
                        True patriot love in all thy sons command.
                        With glowing hearts we see thee rise,
                        The True North strong and free!
                        From far and wide, O Canada,
                        We stand on guard for thee.
                        God keep our land, glorious and free!
                        O Canada, we stand on guard for thee;
                        O Canada, we stand on guard for thee
                        
                        O Canada!
                        Land of our forefathers
                        your front is wreathed with a glorious garland of flowers.
                        Because your arm can wield the sword,
                        it is ready to carry the cross.
                        your history is an epic
                        Of the most brilliant exploits.
                        your valour steeped in faith
                        Wlll protect our homes and our rights
                        Will protect our homes and our rights.
